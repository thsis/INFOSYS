As a baseline model, we use a model that only predicts the last day, i.e. the number of crimes of today are equal to the number of crimes of yesterday."

    "All our models perform around 23 percent better than the baseline model when looking at the L1 Loss, i.e. the loss by absolute number of crime incidences. The models perform similar whereas the results of the simple RNN are not as good as of the LSTM and the GRU model. This might be due to the vanishing gradient problem that can be prevented with LSTM and GRU. Furthermore, these two have very similar loss values.\n",

    "In general, the GRU can be seen as less complex and faster when having lots of data. The LSTM and GRU perform similar, but usually both models are tested to see what performs better for the given data. The LSTM often times reaches better performance than the GRU. This can be argued to be due to the additional cell state which can hold on to information that is not needed for the output and thus can remember information better regarding long-term dependencies."
