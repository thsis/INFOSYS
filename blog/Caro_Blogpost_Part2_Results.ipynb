As a baseline model, we use a model that only predicts the last day, i.e. the number of crimes of today are equal to the number of crimes of yesterday."

    "All our models perform by far better than the baseline model, whereas the others perform similar and also as we would have expected. The results of the simple RNN are not as good as of the LSTM and the GRU model which might be due to the vanishing gradient problem that can be prevented with LSTM and GRU. Furthermore, these two have very similar loss values.\n",

    "In general, the GRU can be seen as less complex and faster when having lots of data. The LSTM and GRU perform similar, but usually both models are tested to see what performs better for the given data. LSTM often times perform a bit better than GRU. This can be argued to be due to the additional cell state which can hold on to information that is not needed for the output and thus can remember information better regarding long-term dependencies."
