    "In order to demonstrate how the backpropagation on the LSTM works we will further investigate our previous example. Remember, that we used a $3 \\times 1$ vector for our single sample. Additionally, we looked at a very simple neural network that has only 2 neurons. Typically, we want to find better weights in each consecutive training iteration and in order to achieve that we follow a fraction of the negative gradient of a loss function.\n",

    "So right now, we need two things:\n",
    "1. a loss function\n",
    "1. and its gradients with respect to each of the weight matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the loss function we can make our lives easier by picking one, that is fit for our regression task while also being easy to derive. One of the easiest loss functions for that matter is the sum of squared errors, which we scale by a convenient constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$loss_t = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( y - \\yhat \\right)^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\yhat$ is the prediction at timestep $t$. When taking the derivative with respect to $\\yhat$ one can easily see:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\deriv{loss_t}{\\yhat} = \\left( y - \\yhat \\right) (-1)$$\n",

    "This is also the reason, why the LSTM architecture remedies the vanishing or exploding gradients. Instead of resulting in a huge product as in the backpropagation through time, we will simply add the gradients of each timestep's contribution \\[[Mallya 2017](http://arunmallya.github.io/writeups/nn/lstm/index.html)\\]."

The most remarkable difference lies in the batch size, where both *LSTM* and *GRU* needed a smaller batch size to be trained effectively, which subsequently increases the time it needs to train them."
